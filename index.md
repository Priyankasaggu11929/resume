# About

## Summary

Resourceful DevOps enthusiast, having experience working with highly distributed infrastructure on hybrid cloud platforms. During the internship at [Atlan](https://atlan.com), I've been working on writing fully automated product releases, with zero interference on the client enterprise end. As a summer trainee at [Dgplug](https://dgplug.org/archive/), I have set up and managed multiple Linux-based servers. Wrote Infrastructure as Code(IaC) to automate setting up of tightly-secured and SSH-hardened systems/servers. Have experience with On-Prem deployment environments using Rancher. And I'm an [Outreachy'19 alum at GNOME Foundation](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) too.
